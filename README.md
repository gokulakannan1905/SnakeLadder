I am Learning programming concepts.

This repo contains snake and ladder game using c++

This is my initial code of the game.
RollDie method is used as  Die(dice) in the game.
I have implemented the logic for finding the position of the player in the game.
snakes and ladders are implemented using dictionary/map datatype.
